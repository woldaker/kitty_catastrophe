## Kitty Catastrophe
  *under construction... will post screenshots soon.*

**A mobile game where you lure your kitties to their litterbox before they poop all over your apartment.**

#### How to play:
*1. Feed your kitties :smiley_cat:!*
  - The more you give 'em, the more **¢AtNIp** you can earn, but be careful... overfeeding shortens your kitties' poop timers :poop::hourglass_flowing_sand: and may result in explosive diarrhea :boom::poop:!

*2. Herd them to their litterbox!*
  - Drop lures such as yarnballs, empty Kleenex boxes :ballot_box:, or rubber mice :mouse:, or repellants such as toy robots :robot: and the always-terrifying vacuum cleaner :scream_cat:.
  
*3. Get enough of your kitties to poop :poop: in the litterbox to win the level and earn **¢AtNIp**!*
  - Fail to do this, however, and... :fire::fire::fire:CATASTROPHE:fire::fire:!!!
  - Watch where your kitties go; they will track anything :paw_prints: they walk in.
  
*4. Spend your **¢AtNIp** at the Kitty Store :convenience_store: to upgrade your available lures and repellants!*

Happy Herding!



###### Will be available on the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store at... some point in the future.  ;)
